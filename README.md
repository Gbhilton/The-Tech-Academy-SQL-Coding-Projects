# The-Tech-Academy-SQL-Coding-Projects

Most of the SQL files contained here are used to not only build a database, but then query against that new database to bring light to the new data.

The more advanced SQL is in the "JDE Import SQL" file, this is the daily SQL I use as import scripts at Praxair Inc. I have built and customized these SQL scripts to pull from JDE using either SQL Server syntax or Oracle Developer. These can be used for generic pull purposes.
